# Beekeeping

This is my journal of my beekeeping hobby.

## 2018

### Next

* Move old hive further behind the garage
* Add medium frames


### 2018-04-26

* Received new queen from Three Rivers Beekeepers club
    * Saskatraz breed
        * Supposed to be good at verroa mite tolerance
        * Supposed to be hearty at over-wintering
    * She's marked with a red dot (I don't think I paid for that)
    * Picked her up at Thies Farm in St. Charles County
* Moved 8 frames of brrod and honey from my original hive into the new hive
    * Found the queen in the old hive; made sure to leave here in the old hive
    * Included all the bees that were on the frames
* Got stung 4 times in the neck
    * The bees were much more agitated than usual
    * I really need to get better protection between my veil and shirt
* Found lots of drone cells/larvae
    * Got rid of some of it
* Found several queen cells
    * Destroyed them, to prevent swarming


### 2018-04-10

* Moved hive from old house to new house
    * Got help from my brother Jason
    * Opened outer cover to tape over the escape hole in the inner cover
    * Taped over front entrance (with entrance reducer)
    * Used 2 ratcheting tie-downs to keep the hive together
        * Included the plastic stand
    * Hive was much lighter than I expected
    * Almost no bees came out while the cover was open or when we finished


### 2018-03-30

* Inspected hive for first time this spring
* Good number of bees
* Decent amount of brood
    * Did not find the queen
        * Saw a few drones
    * Removed 1 queen cell
* Not much honey
* They'd eaten almost all the candy board
    * They replaced about half the space with comb
        * Left that outside the hive for them to scavenge
* Killed 54 hive beetles
    * Saw plenty more
* Got stung 1 time
    * Because I was stupid enough to wear jeans with holes in the knees
* Painted new woodware
