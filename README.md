* Inspected hive for first time this spring
* Good number of bees
* Decent amount of brood
    * Did not find the queen
        * Saw a few drones
    * Removed 1 queen cell
* Not much honey
* They'd eaten almost all the candy board
    * They replaced about half the space with comb
        * Left that outside the hive for them to scavenge
* Killed 54 hive beetles
    * Saw plenty more
* Got stung 1 time
    * Because I was stupid enough to wear jeans with holes in the knees
* Painted new woodware
