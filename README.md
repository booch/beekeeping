# Beekeeping

This is my journal of my beekeeping hobby.

## 2018

### Next

* Make more frames, add to original hive


### 2018-06-18

* Large clump of bees is on corner of the garage
    * I suspect the queen is in the middle of it
        * I suspect she flew there when I had the hive open
    * Tried to grab the cluster to put it back in the hive
    * Tried to brush off the bees
    * Everything I tried just made the bees angry
        * They attacked me several times
            * Smelled like paint when they started attacking
    * Still a small cluster on the garage
        * Worried the queen is up under the siding
        * Worried they will start building comb there
        * Will ask for help Wednesday if they're still there
* Got stung 2 times
    * Through my jeans again


### 2018-06-17

* New Saskatraz hive
    * Honey-bound
    * Had 1 deep and 1 medium
    * Lots of bees
        * Didn't inspect too much, as everything looked good
    * Lots of beetles came out from the bottom box when I moved the top box over
        * Killed 14
        * Didn't open far enough to get more
    * Added medium super with wax foundation
    * Added new feeder with about a quart of 1:1
* Original hive
    * Lots of bees
    * Opened hive, found **lots** of ants and ant larvae on top of outer cover
        * And under the cover
    * Had 1 deep and 1 medium, plus lots of burr comb 
    * Killed 1 beetle
    * Moved further behind the garage (about 4 feet)
        * Also moved it next to the fence instead of next to the garage
        * Had to flip around the stand
    * Added medium super with wax foundation
    * Added new feeder with about a quart of 1:1
* Got stung 2 times
    * Through my jeans, in my thigh
    * Bees got mad when their large burr comb fell over
        * It was where I had not put a frame
    * Ran inside for a half hour to let them calm down
        * They were pretty much calmed down by then
            * Except a few that followed me into the garage and got in my face


### 2018-04-26

* Received new queen from Three Rivers Beekeepers club
    * Saskatraz breed
        * Supposed to be good at verroa mite tolerance
        * Supposed to be hearty at over-wintering
    * She's marked with a red dot (I don't think I paid for that)
    * Picked her up at Thies Farm in St. Charles County
* Moved 8 frames of brrod and honey from my original hive into the new hive
    * Found the queen in the old hive; made sure to leave here in the old hive
    * Included all the bees that were on the frames
* Got stung 4 times in the neck
    * The bees were much more agitated than usual
    * I really need to get better protection between my veil and shirt
* Found lots of drone cells/larvae
    * Got rid of some of it
* Found several queen cells
    * Destroyed them, to prevent swarming


### 2018-04-10

* Moved hive from old house to new house
    * Got help from my brother Jason
    * Opened outer cover to tape over the escape hole in the inner cover
    * Taped over front entrance (with entrance reducer)
    * Used 2 ratcheting tie-downs to keep the hive together
        * Included the plastic stand
    * Hive was much lighter than I expected
    * Almost no bees came out while the cover was open or when we finished


### 2018-03-30

* Inspected hive for first time this spring
* Good number of bees
* Decent amount of brood
    * Did not find the queen
        * Saw a few drones
    * Removed 1 queen cell
* Not much honey
* They'd eaten almost all the candy board
    * They replaced about half the space with comb
        * Left that outside the hive for them to scavenge
* Killed 54 hive beetles
    * Saw plenty more
* Got stung 1 time
    * Because I was stupid enough to wear jeans with holes in the knees
* Painted new woodware
